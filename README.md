# RoboKeyChallenge

A Python-based guessing game that simulates a secure door-unlocking system, inspired by robotics access control (e.g., ROS2, YOLOv11). Players guess a secret key from a dictionary within 6 attempts and verify a passcode to unlock the door. Built to practice Python dictionaries, loops, and conditionals for coding assessments.
Added simple virtual calculator

## Features
- Guess a secret key (e.g., "giraffe") from a dictionary.
- Limited to 6 guesses, with feedback on remaining attempts.
- Passcode verification to unlock a virtual door.
- Robotics-inspired: Mimics secure access in robotic systems.
- Calculate arithmetic simple problems with virtual calculator contained inside the repo

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/RoboKeyChallenge.git`
3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd RoboKeyChallenge`
4. Run the script: `python robo_key_challenge.py`
5. Run the script for running simple calculator: `python virtual_calculator.py`
6. Follow prompts to guess the secret key (e.g., try "giraffe").

## Example Output
```
Guess the secret key: giraffe
You Won!
Your corresponding passcode is 1234
Successfully unlocked the door!
```

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python**: Dictionaries, while loops, conditionals, input handling.
- **Problem-Solving**: Logic for guess limits and passcode checks.
- **Robotics Context**: Inspired by secure access systems in ROS2 and rover projects.
